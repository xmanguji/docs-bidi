I am excited to apply for your React/Next.js website using v0.dev.

and I have successfully developed and optimized scalable applications.

Especially, I have strong understanding of v0.dev with optimized best resulted prompts for ai coding development with best practices.
In the past, I led a team in developing a social media platform with v0.dev including auth, social management widget migration, optimizing performance, cross-browser compatibility as well.
It also supports free 10~15 commands per day, so every users take part in development once project is shared.
I think v0.dev is the best tool for save the development speed includes taking 5~10 seconds to deploy vercel.

Finally, I can work on your timezone. So no worries about that.

Let's discuss how I can help you and join a dynamic team.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
